# Image to PDF Converter

A python code to convert any kind of image in specified path to pdf

## Features

- **Automatic folder processing**: Scans all subfolders within a specified directory
- **Webp file convertor buildin**: Automatically converts WebP images to JPG before adding them to the PDF
- **Bulk processing**: Creates one PDF per folder containing image

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Pillow (PIL) library
- ReportLab library

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Install required library:

```bash
pip install Pillow reportlab
```

## Usage

Run the script from the command line, providing the path to the parent directory containing image folders:

```bash
python auto_imgtopdf.py /path/to/parent/directory
```

### Options

- `--min-images N`: Set the minimum number of images required in a folder to process it (default: 1)

Example:
```bash
python auto_imgtopdf.py /path/to/parent/directory --min-images 5
```
This will only create PDFs for folders containing at least 5 images.

## How It Works

1. The script recursively scans all folders within the specified parent directory
2. For each folder containing image files:
   - WebP images are converted to JPG format in the same folder
   - All image files (original and converted) are sorted by name
   - A PDF is created with the same name as the folder that contain these image
   - Each image is placed on its own page in the PDF
   - The PDF is saved in the same directory in specified path

## Example Directory Structure

Before:
```
parent_directory/
├── vacation_photos/
│   ├── image1.jpg
│   ├── image2.png
│   └── image3.webp
├── work_documents/
│   ├── scan1.jpg
│   └── scan2.jpg
└── empty_folder/
```

After running the script:
```
parent_directory/
├── vacation_photos/
│   ├── image1.jpg
│   ├── image2.png
│   ├── image3.webp
│   └── image3.jpg (converted from WebP)
├── vacation_photos.pdf
├── work_documents/
│   ├── scan1.jpg
│   └── scan2.jpg
├── work_documents.pdf
└── empty_folder/
```

## Troubleshooting

- If a folder is skipped, check that it contains valid image files and you have proper read/write permissions.
